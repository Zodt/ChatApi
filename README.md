# ChatApi

## What's ChatApi?
ChatApi is an unofficial cross-platform collection of libraries for interacting with the [`—Åhat-api`](https://chat-api.com) service. <br/>
It may be used for: sending and reading of messages, work on dialogs (personal chats and groups), accounts, queues for sending messages and blacklist operations. <br/> 
Also WebHook operations for the instant notifications will be available soon.
