## What's ChatApi?

The Chat Api is an unofficial cross-platform collection of libraries for interacting with the [`—Åhat-api`](https://chat-api.com) service based on the WhatsApp API. <br/>
It may be used for: sending and reading of messages, work on dialogs (personal chats and groups), accounts, queues for sending messages and blacklist operations for WhatsApp messenger. <br/> 
Also WebHook operations for the instant notifications will be available soon.

**<span style="color:orange">Warning</span>** Before using these libraries, we are recommended to read the documentation provided on [`Russian`](Documentation/ru-RU/README.md) and [`English`](Documentation/en-EN/README.md).
